#Explanation
'''
First construct a list with the values from 1 to the number of friends inclusive. Then go through each removal round by taking
in a 'removeMultiple'. We iterate through the friends list by index and if the index is a multiple of removeMultiple, we need to
remove that value from the list. Keep in mind that for loops are 0-indexed (start from 0). Also keep in mind that performing 
operations on a list while you are iterating though it might cause some errors, so you might want to instead keep a copy of the
list with the unwanted values removed and then copy that list over to your original list instead of directly removing values
from the original list while you are iterating through it.

#Code
#Get input
numFriends = int(input())
numRemovals = int(input())

friends = [] #Stores the current friends we are inviting
remainingFriends = [] #Stores the friends we will be inviting during each round of removal (because removing elements form 
#a list while iterating through it is not a good idea)

#Construct the friends list
for i in range(numFriends):
  friends.append(i+1)

#Remove the friends
for i in range(numRemovals):
  removeMutiple = int(input())
  for j in range(len(friends)):
    if (j+1) % removeMutiple != 0: #j+1 because the for loop is 0-indexed
      remainingFriends.append(friends[j])
  
  #Copy the remainingFriends into friends
  friends = []
  for friend in remainingFriends:
    friends.append(friend)
  remainingFriends = []

#Output
for friend in friends:
  print(friend)
